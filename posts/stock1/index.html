<p>Both positive quarterly earnings in the third quarter 2020. Not profitable yearly though.</p>
<p>Housing demand surge by COVID can be a reason.</p>
<p>How to be profitable remains questionable.</p>
<p><strong>Both offers two choices: sell directly to third parity or sell to company.</strong></p>
<p>Direct buying (by the company for resale) services are called <strong>Instant Offer</strong> and <strong>RedfinNow</strong></p>
<p>Claimed impZortant metric on 10K: online visitors</p>
<p>They are quite similar.</p>
<p>Redfin has higher Y/Y unique visitor growth.
Redfin having trouble finding enough employees. This will continue through second quarter of 2021</p>
<p>(In November 2020) Zillow is priced at a premium.</p>
<h3 id="whats-disruptive-about-these-two-is-the-direct-home-buying-service"><strong>What’s disruptive about these two is the direct home buying service?</strong></h3>
<p>However, Zillow appears to be expanding faster than Redfin on this, meaning that Redfin is less of a pure play on this disruptive concept.</p>
<p>“Zillow has been clear about its plans to ramp up its Homes segment, and can move faster into new markets as it relies on its advertising platform to attract agents rather than Redfin&rsquo;s approach of hiring them directly.” A claim from the blog that tells the difference. But we need more specific examples on this.</p>
