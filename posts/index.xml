      <description>Sound event detection #2: Kaggle is REAL It&amp;rsquo;s funny seeing myself complaining about how long (an afternoon) it took to research SED before entering the competition. Because in the past 10 days, I spent 70% (to say the least) of all sitting time on the competition, reading, familiarizing, coding, training, inferring, failing. It&amp;rsquo;s addictive and people here are competitive and SERIOUS about the competition. And yet I still could not match the public baseline with 20 days to go (the public score now is 0.</description>

      <description>Sound event detection: what and how Layout:
 Problem definition Deep learning Methods Challenges A real example References  Problem definition Sound event detection (SED): Task to identify the type of sound event. May also identify start/end time in the long audio stream.
Like most problems, SED relies on labeling, or the start/end time locations. A concept called weak labeling exists in SED world, which refers to labels telling only types of sound events.</description>

      <description>Creative coding: 1st attempt layout:
 creative coding and javascript generative learning  Creative coding and js The other day I came across this blog post by Professor Zach Lieberman, summarizing his journey creating one coding sketch everyday in 2017.
Generative learning Generative arts, creative coding, generative coding.. These all fo some reason hint on the use of machine learning/deep learning. Actually they share one similarity. They are both, to some extent, abstract/mysterious/unexplainable.</description>

      <description>A summary of a Zillow and Redfin comparison SA article by Dan Owens. Both positive quarterly earnings in the third quarter 2020. Not profitable yearly though.
Housing demand surge by COVID can be a reason.
How to be profitable remains questionable.
Both offers two choices: sell directly to third parity or sell to company.
Direct buying (by the company for resale) services are called Instant Offer and RedfinNow

      <title>Lex podcast jot: meaning of life and human being 2-dimensional</title>

      <description>These are some notes on Lex&amp;rsquo;s podcast.
I find it&amp;rsquo;s quite difficult to talk about the subject of the meaning of life because no one truly understand the mystery of life and this is a rare situation where the difference in knowledge between audience and talker is narrow. At a result, to those philosophical and vague hypothesis/questions without substantial answers, often the listener&amp;rsquo;s reaction is like &amp;ldquo;but &amp;rsquo;ve also thought about before (I&amp;rsquo;m here for an answer)&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>VAE: reasoning process</title>

      <description>No math, just bullet points! to stopped being constantly bothered by theories behind VAE.
Start with GMM: each z corresponds to a cluster.
Optimizing log probability of GMM: wonâ€™t work because you have to sample the unique z that correspond to an x. Otherwise the other sampled p(x|z) are virtually zero (so no gradients).
Distributed representation: an important catch: e.g. binary features result in 2^n, rather than n, clusters.
Thus, the chance of sampling a useful z is 1/(2^n).</description>
