      <div class="post-content"><p>These are some notes on Lex&rsquo;s podcast.</p>
<p>I find it&rsquo;s quite difficult to talk about the subject of <em>the meaning of life</em> because no one truly understand the mystery of life and this is a rare situation where the difference in knowledge between audience and talker is narrow. At a result, to those philosophical and vague hypothesis/questions without substantial answers, often the listener&rsquo;s reaction is like &ldquo;but &rsquo;ve also thought about before (I&rsquo;m here for an answer)&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Still, there are occationally good ideas that at least can serve as a seed, or starting point, for self meditation, which could potentially lead to some fruitful inner conclusion.</p>
<p>The first clip I pick up is the on with Aaron Brooks.</p>
<p>The subject: What are the principles of a life well lived?</p>
<ul>
<li>To live with thought, to live rational life, to think it thru</li>
<li>I think lots of people live like zombie, Their mind is not focused on “what do I need to do”</li>
<li>Most of people go thru the motion of living rather than embrace</li>
<li>The secret is to take it seriously</li>
<li>Use the one tool that provides value: our mind or reason</li>
<li>Apply it to the living. People use it in work, math, programming&hellip; But imagine if they use that same energy same focus to actually live life  - and choose value that they should pursue.</li>
<li>We have different way to condition our consciousness: &ldquo;I am serious now&rdquo; *wears suit and tie</li>
<li>Every minute is valuable. People don’t have respect for the time and their mind.</li>
<li>People do amazing jobs in work. But what if they apply that to everything in life.</li>
<li>Experiencing moment vs thinking through:</li>
<li>Experiencing is the easy part. The problem is people don’t use their mind in planning their life, in thinking about how to live. There is no other source of knowledge: we don’t know anything other from the sense of our mind. Reasoning is how human survive.</li>
<li>We are not programmed to hunt, to do agriculture, or to program. All of that requires focus, energy, will, and choice. Once you make that  - choice, you have to engage, and in work to.</li>
<li>What’s screwing up the world is that people have the wrong values, they don’t think about them, don’t focus, don’t make plan about life.</li>
<li>We have the ability to reject our mind and reasoning (e.g. suicide). To focus or to not focus.</li>
<li>It requires an act of will to say I got do something waking up.</li>
<li>You have to turn something on. This is not determined. You choose it.</li>
<li>We don’t really know how brain works, what is efficent. But the beauty of human brain is the potentialities that we have to manifest through our choices. How we evoke different senses.</li>
</ul>
