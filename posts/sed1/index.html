<h2 id="problem-definition">Problem definition</h2>
<p>Sound event detection (SED): Task to identify the type of sound event. May also <strong>identify start/end time</strong> in the long audio stream.</p>
<p>Like most problems, SED relies on labeling, or the start/end time locations. A concept called <strong>weak labeling</strong> exists in SED world, which refers to labels telling only types of sound events. A famous such dataset (named <strong>Audio Set</strong>) is by Google.</p>
<p>There is also a thing called 2017 DCASE challenge, which is a dataset and asks people to solve weakly labeled SED tasks.</p>
<p>How to predict? Easy:</p>
<ul>
<li>For each audio stream, predict binary label for each sound event at <strong>local substream</strong></li>
<li>Combine results using a <strong>pooling function</strong></li>
<li>(This may be referred to as multiple instance learning)</li>
</ul>
<p>[1] talks about some pooling methods: Max, Average, Linear, Exp, Attention.</p>
<p>You can probably guess what Max and Average pooling mean. The latter three are less obvious, but just some function to map y to [0,1].</p>
<p><em>A termâ€”standard multiple instance (SMI)</em>: an assumption that if one segment (or instance) is positive, the entire audio stream is positive. Note that this is not guaranteed for options other than max pooling.</p>
<p>Question a: Wait. They use attention. The paper also anaylizes gradients for poolings. So pooling is part of training?</p>
<p>Answer a: Yes. This is (as I interpret) due to the fact that the problem is weakly supervised (so you only know the aggregated labels). In the <strong>supervised</strong> Kaggle example discussed later, however, the problem gives specific timeframes at which sound events occur/end, which may require slightly different approaches.</p>
<p>Then, something about audio preprocessing conventions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filterbank features with input as 400 frames and 64 frequency bins</li>
</ul>
