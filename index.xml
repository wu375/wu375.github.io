      <description>Sound event detection: what and how Layout:
 Problem definition Deep learning Methods Challenges A real example References  Problem definition Sound event detection (SED): Task to identify the type of sound event. May also identify start/end time in the long audio stream.
Like most problems, SED relies on labeling, or the start/end time locations. A concept called weak labeling exists in SED world, which refers to labels telling only types of sound events.</description>

      <description>Creative coding: 1st attempt layout:
 creative coding and javascript generative learning  Creative coding and js Generative learning So can I do this?
Looking into my toolbox, the only thing that somewhat links to art and creativity is deep learning.
Question: What can deep learning do in creative coding/art?
This is obviously not a new question at all. We have all those generative models like conditional gans that turn pictures into art works.</description>

      <description>A summary of a Zillow and Redfin comparison SA article by Dan Owens. Both positive quarterly earnings in the third quarter 2020. Not profitable yearly though.
Housing demand surge by COVID can be a reason.
How to be profitable remains questionable.
Both offers two choices: sell directly to third parity or sell to company.
Direct buying (by the company for resale) services are called Instant Offer and RedfinNow

      <description>Play interactive fiction games with reinforcement learning *A report written for school, thus the (annoying) verboseness
*Chose the topic thanks to the Wordplay workshop at NeurIPS 2020 (did not attend, just reading papers)

      <description>No math, just bullet points! to stopped being constantly bothered by theories behind VAE.
Start with GMM: each z corresponds to a cluster.
Optimizing log probability of GMM: wonâ€™t work because you have to sample the unique z that correspond to an x. Otherwise the other sampled p(x|z) are virtually zero (so no gradients).
Distributed representation: an important catch: e.g. binary features result in 2^n, rather than n, clusters.
Thus, the chance of sampling a useful z is 1/(2^n).</description>
