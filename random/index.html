<p>bullet-pointize (almost) everything</p>

<p>We all have our inner Rocket scientists. Analyze the worst/best scenarios before making decisions. Look at things with <strong>first principle</strong>: is there any unjustified assumptions? Do I really have to buy a rocket, not bulding one?</p>

<p>Max Tegmark (paraphrase): AI can control human mind. In fact it is already doing it (thus AI security is important and needs more fundings). AI tricks us into buying stuff we don&rsquo;t really need, and maybe into voting the leaders we don&rsquo;t want. And this control can easily get stronger because human minds are vulnerable to being controlled. For example, dogs and cats don&rsquo;t need to do a lot to easily trick our mind into loving them. Our cells are also controlling us: we can&rsquo;t help eating so that they can reproduce.</p>

<p>The Internet should eventually be infiltrating every single aspect in the world and causing a lot of &ldquo;this time it&rsquo;s different&rdquo; type of incident. As much as I respect the concept of everything is cyclical, I have this perhaps biased belief in the Internet and technology in general.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe the Gamestop incident belongs to that &ldquo;this time it&rsquo;s different&rdquo; category. I bought some at ~$320.</p>
