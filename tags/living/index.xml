      <description>These are some notes on Lex&amp;rsquo;s podcast.
I find it&amp;rsquo;s quite difficult to talk about the subject of the meaning of life because no one truly understand the mystery of life and this is a rare situation where the difference in knowledge between audience and talker is narrow. At a result, to those philosophical and vague hypothesis/questions without substantial answers, often the listener&amp;rsquo;s reaction is like &amp;ldquo;but &amp;rsquo;ve also thought about before (I&amp;rsquo;m here for an answer)&amp;rdquo;.</description>
